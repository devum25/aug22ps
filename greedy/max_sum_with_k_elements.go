// You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. Your task is to perform the following operation exactly k times in order to maximize your score:

// Select an element m from nums.
// Remove the selected element m from the array.
// Add a new element with a value of m + 1 to the array.
// Increase your score by m.
// Return the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation exactly k times.

// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
// Output: 18
// Explanation: We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.
// For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]
// For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]
// For the third iteration, we choose 7. Then sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 and nums = [1,2,3,4,8]
// So, we will return 18.
// It can be proven, that 18 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.
