// Given an array of strings A of size N, find if the given strings can be chained to form a circle.

// A string X can be put before another string Y in circle if the last character of X is same as first character of Y.

// NOTE: All strings consist of lower case characters.

// Input 1:

//  A = ["aab", "bac", "aaa", "cda"]

//  We can chain the strings aab -> bac -> cda -> aaa -> aab. So this forms a circle. So, output will be 1.
