// There is a rectangle with left bottom as (0, 0) and right up as (x, y).
// There are N circles such that their centers are inside the rectangle.
// Radius of each circle is R. Now we need to find out if it is possible that we can move from (0, 0) to (x, y) without touching any circle.
// Note : We can move from any cell to any of its 8 adjecent neighbours and we cannot move outside the boundary of the rectangle at any point of time.
